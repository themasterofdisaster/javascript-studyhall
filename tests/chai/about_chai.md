# About Chai 

Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be paired with any javascript testing framework.

Chai documentation: https://www.chaijs.com/

### Assertion Styles

Chai supports 2 different interfases to implement assertions: Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD). 
It also provides 3 different assertion styles that you may use in your testing environment according to the style that's been selected for the tests. Assert for TDD; Expect and Should for BDD. 

Once you have made your selection, it is recommended that you look at the API Documentation for your selected style.

### Installing Chai

As a prerequisite, Node JS has to be installed on the machine.
Download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Run the installer and follow instructions. 

To verify that you have successfully installed node enter the following on the terminal: 
`node --version`

Create a project (I created something simple using Visual Studio Code). 
And add the Chai library to the project by running the following on the terminal

Make sure to navigate to the project path
`npn install chai -save-dev`
