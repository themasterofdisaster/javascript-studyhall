# About Chai 

Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be paired with any javascript testing framework.

Chai documentation: https://www.chaijs.com/

### Assertion Styles

Chai supports 2 different interfases to implement assertions: Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD). 
It also provides 3 different assertion styles that you may use in your testing environment according to the style that's been selected for the tests. Assert for TDD; Expect and Should for BDD. 

Once you have made your selection, it is recommended that you look at the API Documentation for your selected style.

### Installing Chai

As a prerequisite, Node JS has to be installed on the machine.
Download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Run the installer and follow instructions. 

To verify that you have successfully installed node enter the following on the terminal: 
`node --version`

Create a project (I created something simple using Visual Studio Code). 
Add Chai library to your project by navigating to the path of the project:
`cd devmm/javascipt-studyhall`

And run the following command to install: 
`npm isntall chai -save-dev`


### Running Chai Tests

Simply run the following command from the terminal. Make sure you are in the correct directory.

`node tests/chai/expect.js`
